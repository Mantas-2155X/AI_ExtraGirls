# AI_ExtraGirls  
This plugin allows you to have more than the default amount of girls in free roam.

**Please report any issues here:** https://github.com/Mantas-2155X/AI_ExtraGirls/issues  

**WARNING**  
* When adding new girls in the girl selection menu, it is recommended to only create 4 or less at a time because the game can't keep up has trouble reloading them.  

**If you want to remove the plugin**, to fix a save for usage without this plugin:  
* Set girls count to default (4), restart.  
* Open settings menu (to fix system.xml),  
* Load in the game and save (to fix WorldData).  
* You can now remove the plugin or share the save with others who don't have it.  

Needs https://github.com/IllusionMods/BepisPlugins for configuration to work!
