# AI_ExtraGirls  
This plugin allows you to have more than the default amount of girls in free roam.

**Please report any issues here:** https://github.com/Mantas-2155X/AI_ExtraGirls/issues  

**WARNING**  
* This plugin will modify your save to use the amount of girls set in the configuration. This will cause the save to stop working if you remove the plugin or give the save to anyone without this plugin. Setting girl count back to the default and saving should be fine to share or remove the plugin.  
* When adding new girls in the girl selection menu, it is recommended to only create 4 or less at a time because illusion has trouble loading them.  

Needs https://github.com/IllusionMods/BepisPlugins for configuration to work!
